# Overview
An analysis was done by accumulating all bacteria culture samples from different subject's bellybuttons. 
An analyst first compiled the data to create an interactive dashboard where users can select a certain subject's ID and see more general info on the species that live in their bellybuttons.

## Using Plotly, there were three visuals presented on the dashboard:
* a bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial cultures found in all the samples a gauge that shows bacteria species found in correlation with the frequency of how often the bellybuttons were washed:

* finally, a bubble chart that displays bacterial cultures per sample:
